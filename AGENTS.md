# TeamAI CLI

CLI for syncing team skills, rules, docs, and env across AI coding tools. Package: [`teamai-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/teamai-cli).

TypeScript, Node 20+, tsup (ESM), Vitest. Commands: `npm run build`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx vitest run`.

## Git

- Default branch: `main`. Worktrees and PRs based on `origin/main`.
- PR only to `Tencent/teamai-cli`. Before push, check `git log origin/main..HEAD`; rebase or cherry-pick if unrelated commits appear.
- 默认在当前项目目录工作。仅在用户要求隔离、并行开发或改动风险较高时使用 Worktree。

## Rules

- CLI user-facing output must be English. No Chinese in production code. Tests assert English output.
- Keep bilingual docs in sync (`README` / `*.zh-CN.md`, `docs/usage-guide.*`). Behavior changes must update every affected doc (including `docs/designs/`); grep old wording before opening the PR.
- **README 精简**：尽量少改动 README，保持简洁。确需改动时，所有语言版本（`README.md` 及全部 `README.*.md`，改前先 `ls README*` 确认清单）必须全部改完并保持一致。
- **奥卡姆剃刀**：避免过早添加新 CLI 命令；非必要不加；优先复用或扩展现有命令与选项。

## PR 前测试

`npm run build` 后用真实 CLI 对本次改动做完整端到端验证（不能只跑 type check / unit test）。Test Plan 每一项必须实际通过，测试报告贴进 PR。

- Agent：Claude、Codex、CodeBuddy、OpenCode
- Provider：`git`、`gitlab`、`github`

## Code Review Rules

- The PR description must document sufficient testing, including an
  end-to-end / real-CLI verification record — not only unit tests or type
  checks. Flag a PR whose description lacks a test plan or an e2e record.
- Reject over-engineering. Favor the smallest code that solves the problem;
  flag speculative abstractions, unused flexibility or config, error handling
  for cases that cannot occur, and new CLI commands added where an existing
  command could be reused or extended.
- Changes must be surgical. Every changed line should trace directly to the
  PR's stated goal; flag unrelated drive-by edits.
- Label every finding with an explicit severity a first-time reader can
  understand — never a bare `P1`/`P2` code. Keep the `P` marker but spell out
  what it means inline on each finding, using the PR author's language:
  `[P1 blocking]` for issues that must be fixed before merge, and
  `[P2 non-blocking]` for suggestions that do not block merge. (In Chinese,
  `[P1 阻断]` / `[P2 非阻断]`.)
